# 95percentV2
a new version of the my last repository project, a copy of 95% threshold by Alva Majo but with HTML CSS and JS

So, my name is Felipe Rozas and im starting with webdev, i made this copy of the 95% threshlod made by the spanish idie game developer Alva Majo, all rights are his, this was
just a chalenge for myself as a new web dev.

I use only HTML CSS an pure JS. I also took a few free items from fontsawsome, and obiously abused of stackoverflow when needed.

This is my second serious atempt to make this game, las time i use just what i found and coud implement given my knowlege and experience at the time, now i mdid several things 
better and i would like to share my project.

Almost every abstract element is an object now, y had a better flow control and add a new aceleration mechanic, also, all was divs and tags, i use no canves here nor before.
